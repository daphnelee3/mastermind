# Mastermind

You are the codebreaker and your goal is to break the secret code provided by the codemaker. At the start of the game, you are given 10 attempts. After each guess, the codemaker provides feedback to help you deduce the correct code.

Feedback consists of two components: exact matches represented by black circles where the guess is the correct color and in the correct position. Partial matches represented by white circles where the guess is the correct color but in the wrong position. Good luck!
